# SwiftSheets
## ECS506U Software Engineering Group Project
###  Description
This website is the prototype for the ECS506U Software Engineering Group Project Module. We developed a timesheet web-application for the [FDM Group](https://www.fdmgroup.com). The application presents views for four types of specialised users and one general user:
- **System User**: all users are able to log in and log out, update and reset password.
- **Consultant**: they are able to log and edit events, submit timesheets.
- **Line Manager**: they are able to view a Consultant's timesheet, amend any errors, revoke the timesheet, and change the review status.
- **Finance Team Member**: they are able to view a Consultant's timesheet, and change the payment status.
- **System Administrator**: they are able to add, remove and update users, and view form responses from other users.

### Frameworks, languages and tools
- **React.js** and CSS for Front-End
- **Djanjo** for the Back-End and Database Management
- **GitHub** for file management and structure
  
### Collaborators


### Features to complete and fix
- Auto-submission for timesheet
- Reminder notification for timesheet completion
